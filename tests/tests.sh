# TODO: IDEAS:
# * Put all tests in a list, so you can target a test by passing it's index
# * ðŸŸ¢ PASS, ðŸ”´ FAILED, or ðŸŸ¡ LEAK after the test (on the next line)
# * Print Received in RED with the output of minishell
# * Print Expected in GREEN with the output of bash
# * Save the bash outputs in a file
# * Test entire section at a time, and you can target sections too
# * Options inside the test script to load sections or specific tests
# * Doomslayer helmet in green at the end if pass on all tests (maybe sections too?)
# * Setup and create config file at the first time, prompting for minishell location
